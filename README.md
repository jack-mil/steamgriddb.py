## griddb.py WIP##
Python command line utility to interact with
[Steam Grid API](https://www.steamgriddb.com/)

Minimal functionality currently

TODO
- [ ] Implement commands for all functions of the [API](https://www.steamgriddb.com/api/v2)
- [ ] Somehow show previews of images and select individual ones to download with minimal dependencies (possible?)
- [ ] Make interactive mode
- [ ] Refactor to work also as an API library ([no python implementation exists](https://www.steamgriddb.com/api/v2#section/Libraries))
- [ ] Package as pip library for installation as executable
